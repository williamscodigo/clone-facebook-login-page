# (clone)Facebook-log-in-page

In this project I attempt to replicate the responsive layout for 
facebook log in page https://www.facebook.com (layout) as of 10/9/2021. I have focus on the UI using only HTML5 and CSS3. I have included a folder with 2 screenshots to show the page layout (in case it changes in the future) as reference. 

## Comment

This project have help me have a better understanding about how to write responside website layouts. In more details it taught me how to organize my files for a web development project, how to use Chrome Developer tools to debug my code, how to work with css flexbox and also reinforced my basic knowledge of git/github.

note: any positive, informative or encouraging comments about this project or just how to write better code in general will be greatly appreciated.
